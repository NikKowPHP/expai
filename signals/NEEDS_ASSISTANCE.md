I am unable to complete the task: "Repeat this process for all user-specific tables." under "2.3: Implement Row Level Security (RLS)".

My instructions explicitly state that I operate in a static-only mode and cannot interact with external dashboards or run SQL queries. This task requires manual interaction with the Supabase Dashboard.

Please adjust the task or provide alternative instructions that do not involve manual database configuration.
