# 1. Choice of Sentry for Error Tracking

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed a robust error tracking solution that would:
- Capture client-side and server-side errors
- Provide detailed stack traces
- Support performance monitoring
- Integrate with our Next.js application
- Offer good alerting capabilities

## Decision
We chose Sentry because:
1. **Comprehensive Error Tracking**: Captures errors with full context including stack traces, environment, and user data
2. **Next.js Integration**: Official Sentry SDK has excellent Next.js support
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks performance metrics alongside errors
4. **Alerting**: Flexible alerting rules and integrations
5. **Self-Hosted Option**: Can be self-hosted if needed for compliance

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Improved error visibility and debugging
  - Better user experience through faster issue resolution
  - Performance insights alongside error tracking
- **Negative**:
  - Additional dependency in the project
  - Requires proper configuration to avoid sensitive data leakage
  - Potential cost at scale
